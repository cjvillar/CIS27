Create a class with 12 methods
the class will accept a file with 1000 rand ints

read the rand nums from the file into an array and feed that to the following methods:

    define outpur all values:
        ouput all

    define output sum of all values:
        add all values and output

    define output all odd values:
        add all odd values and output

    define output all even values:
        add all even values and output

    define linear search:
        this method will take array, size and target
        loop through array until target found

    define middle value:
        this mathod takes array, size:
        loop through and find middle value
        array is always 1000 so no need to worry about even or odd.

    define first value:
        return the first element in the array
    
    define last value:
        retrun last element in array

    define lowest value and location:
        loop through each element and compaire then for the smallest int

    define highest value and location:
        loop through each element and compaire then for the largest int

    define bubbleSort:
        implement bubble sort

    define ouput mean average:
        implement mean average

main 
loop menu with do while in main:
create objects for each option
accept user input
